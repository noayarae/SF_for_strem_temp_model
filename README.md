### Code to compute the Shade-Factor (SF) 

This code compute the SF, which was added to the Ficklin stream temperature model (Improved Ficklin stream temperature model) and later to the SWAT model. This approach has been used in analyzes of the effects of the shade-factor of the riparian vegetation of the Dairy-McKay basin, Oregon, US on water temperature, which were shown in the publication "An improved model of shade-affected stream temperature in Soil & Water Assessment Tool"
